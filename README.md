# SR Protocol 2D Simulation üöÄ

This project provides an interactive 2D visualization of the Selective Repeat (SR) protocol using Three.js. The simulation offers a comprehensive understanding of how the SR protocol works in computer networks, allowing users to observe and interact with packet transmission between sender and receiver nodes in real-time.

## üìñ What is Selective Repeat Protocol?

The Selective Repeat (SR) Protocol is a sliding window protocol used in computer networks for reliable data transmission. Here's how it works:

- **Multiple Packet Transmission**: Unlike simpler protocols, SR allows multiple packets to be in transit simultaneously
- **Individual Acknowledgments**: Each packet is acknowledged separately, allowing for selective retransmission
- **Sliding Window**: The protocol maintains a window of packets that can be sent without acknowledgment
- **Error Recovery**: Only lost or corrupted packets are retransmitted, improving efficiency
- **Out-of-Order Handling**: Can accept packets that arrive out of sequence, storing them in a buffer

### How it Works

1. **Initial State**

```
Sender: [P0][P1][P2][P3]  ‚Üí  Network  ‚Üí  Receiver: [P0][P1][P2][P3]
```

- Sender initializes with a window of packets
- Receiver prepares to accept packets in sequence

2. **During Transmission**

```
Sender: [P0][P1][P2][P3]  ‚Üí  P0,P1,P2  ‚Üí  Receiver: [P0][P1][P2][P3]
```

- Multiple packets can be in transit simultaneously
- Each packet is tracked individually
- Acknowledgments are sent for received packets

3. **After Acknowledgment**

```
Sender: [P4][P5][P6][P7]  ‚Üí  P3,P4,P5  ‚Üí  Receiver: [P4][P5][P6][P7]
```

- Window slides forward based on acknowledgments
- New packets enter the window
- Lost packets are selectively retransmitted
